# Potentiometer-Controlled Background Color for Image Display

This project allows you to change the background color of an image using a potentiometer connected to an Arduino. The Arduino reads the analog value from the potentiometer and sends this value to a Processing sketch, which then adjusts the background color of a displayed image accordingly.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Potentiometer
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable for Arduino

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Processing IDE

## Circuit Diagram

1. Connect the middle pin of the potentiometer to the analog input pin `A0` on the Arduino.
2. Connect the other two pins of the potentiometer to the 5V and GND pins on the Arduino.
