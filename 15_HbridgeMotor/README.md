# L293D DC Motor Controller

This Arduino project controls a DC motor using an L293D H-bridge motor driver. It allows you to turn the motor on/off, adjust its speed with a potentiometer, and change its direction with switches.

## Hardware Required

- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- L293D H-bridge motor driver
- DC motor
- Potentiometer
- 2x switches
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- 2x resistors

## Connections

Connect the L293D motor driver to the Arduino and other components according to the included video or follow a reference guide for L293D pin connections.

## Usage

1. Turn the potentiometer knob to adjust the motor speed.
2. Flip one switch to turn the motor on or off.
3. Toggle the other switch to change the motor's direction.
