# Tilt-Ball Switch Timer with Arduino

## Overview

This Arduino project utilizes a tilt-ball switch to reset a timer represented by a series of five red LEDs. A new LED lights up every 2 seconds.

## Functionality

The project achieves the following functionality:

- Utilizes a tilt-ball switch as a trigger to reset the timer.
- Displays the timer using five red LEDs, with each LED lighting up at intervals of 2 seconds.
- Resets the timer sequence upon activation of the tilt-ball switch by tilting the breadbord.

## Usage

To use the project:

1. Connect the components as follows:
   - Tilt-ball switch: Pin A0
   - LEDs: Pins 2 to 6 (led1 to led5)
   
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.

3. When the tilt-ball switch is triggered (tilted), it resets the timer sequence.
