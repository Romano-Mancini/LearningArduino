# My Arduino Learning Playground üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to Arduino learning! Here, I store small Arduino projects tailored for educational purposes. Each project is designed to deepen my understanding of various concepts in Arduino/Elegoo programming and electronics. From fundamental LED manipulation to intricate sensor interactions, these projects serve as hands-on experiments and learning exercises.
As I acquire more knowledge, projects will progressively become more complex. This means that they are currently ordered from the easiest to the hardest. I will often use the Elegoo Uno R3 board as a replacement of the Arduino Uno R3.

## Exploration and Collaboration

Feel free to delve into the code and hardware setups provided. While these projects primarily serve my learning journey, I encourage you to draw inspiration or propose enhancements if you find them beneficial.
